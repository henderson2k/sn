Hi Yvonne , sorry trouble getting through. Would you please ask Dr Bhatti if the issue persists on his PC, following the clear-out of files?

Hi Andrew, Dr Bhatti is now in his office. I have spoken to him and he said he will be around now for a few hours. If it is easier for you to phone him I am on 01698 752695 or internal 402695 and I can transfer you through to him. Thanks! Yvonne

Andrew sorry Dr Bhatti is on annual leave today. He is back in the office on Monday. I will get him to update you as I see he hasn't responded. He is still having problems with his pc/laptop.
